# data-cubed-api

A simple API assignment from Data Cubed.

Premise:
Please write a Python server that takes the addresses of 3 locations (valid addresses recognizable by the Google API ) and outputs the distance and time taken of the most efficient route going through all 3 locations. No front end is necessary, the server may be queried via CURL with results being in a form of a JSON file. External APIs may be used for this assignment.

For a bonus, allow as input an arbitrary number of locations as opposed to just 3.
